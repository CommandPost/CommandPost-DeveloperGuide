Various features/facilities for developers who are working on Hammerspoon itself, or writing extensions for it. It is extremely unlikely that you should need any part of this extension, in a normal user configuration.

## API Overview

## API Documentation

### Variables

#### [crashLogToNSLog](#crashLogToNSLog)
| | |
|-|-|
| Signature   | hs.crash.crashLogToNSLog  |
| Type        | Variable |
| Description | A boolean value of true will log Hammerspoon's crash log with NSLog, false will silently capture messages in case of a crash. Defaults to false. |

### Functions

#### [attemptMemoryRelease](#attemptMemoryRelease)
| | |
|-|-|
| Signature   | hs.crash.attemptMemoryRelease()  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Attempts to reduce RAM usage of Hammerspoon |
| Parameters |  * None | | Returns |  * None | | Notes |  * This function will print some memory usage numbers (in bytes) to the Hammerspoon Console before and after forcing Lua's garbage collector | 
#### [crash](#crash)
| | |
|-|-|
| Signature   | hs.crash.crash()  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Causes Hammerspoon to immediately crash |
| Parameters |  * None | | Returns |  * None | | Notes |  * This is for testing purposes only, you are extremely unlikely to need this in normal Hammerspoon usage | 
#### [crashKV](#crashKV)
| | |
|-|-|
| Signature   | hs.crash.crashKV(key, value)  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Sets a key/value pair in any Crashlytics crash dump generated by this Hamerspoon session |
| Parameters |  * key - A string containing the key name of the pair * value - A string containing the value of the pair | | Returns |  * None | 
#### [crashLog](#crashLog)
| | |
|-|-|
| Signature   | hs.crash.crashLog(logMessage)  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Leaves a breadcrumb log message in any Crashlytics crash dump generated by this Hammerspoon session |
| Parameters |  * logMessage - A string containing a message to log | | Returns |  * None | | Notes |  * This is probably only useful to extension developers. If you are trying to track down a confusing crash, and you have access to the Crashlytics project for Hammerspoon (or access to someone who has access!), this can be a useful way to leave breadcrumbs from Lua in the crash dump | 
#### [dumpCLIBS](#dumpCLIBS)
| | |
|-|-|
| Signature   | hs.crash.dumpCLIBS() -> table  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Dumps the contents of Lua's CLIBS registry |
| Parameters |  * None | | Returns |  * A table containing all the paths of C libraries that have been loaded into the Lua runtime | | Notes |  * This is probably only useful to extension developers as a useful way of ensuring that you are loading C libraries from the places you expect. | 
#### [residentSize](#residentSize)
| | |
|-|-|
| Signature   | hs.crash.residentSize() -> integer or nil  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Gets the resident size of the Hammerspoon process |
| Parameters |  * None | | Returns |  * An integer containing the amount of RAM in use by Hammerspoon (in bytes), or nil if an error occurred | 
#### [throwObjCException](#throwObjCException)
| | |
|-|-|
| Signature   | hs.crash.throwObjCException(name, message)  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Causes Hammerspoon to generate an Objective C exception |
  Paramters:
     * name - A string containing the name of the exception
     * message - A human readabke string explaining the exception
| Returns |  * None | | Notes |  * Outside of a context of a Lua pcall() (or a C lua_pcall()), this will cause Hammerspoon to exit. We follow the safe behaviour of terminating the app on any unhandled Objective C exception. |
