# [docs](index.md) Â» hs.watchable
---

A minimalistic Key-Value-Observer framework for Lua.

This module allows you to generate a table with a defined label or path that can be used to share data with other modules or code.  Other modules can register as watchers to a specific key-value pair within the watchable object table and will be automatically notified when the key-value pair changes.

The goal is to provide a mechanism for sharing state information between separate and (mostly) unrelated code easily and in an independent fashion.

## API Documentation
### Constructors

#### [new](#new)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.watchable.new(path, [externalChanges]) -> table  |
| Type        | Constructor |
| Description | Creates a table that can be watched by other modules for key changes |
| Parameters |  * `path`            - the global name for this internal table that external code can refer to the table as. * `externalChanges` - an optional boolean, default false, specifying whether external code can make changes to keys within this table (bi-directional communication). |
| Returns |  * a table with metamethods which will notify external code which is registered to watch this table for key-value changes. |
| Notes |  * This constructor is used by code which wishes to share state information which other code may register to watch.

#### [watch](#watch)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.watchable.watch(path, [key], callback) -> watchableObject  |
| Type        | Constructor |
| Description | Creates a watcher that will be invoked when the specified key in the specified path is modified. |
| Parameters |  * `path`     - a string specifying the path to watch.  If `key` is not provided, then this should be a string of the form "path.key" where the key will be identified as the string after the last "." * `key`      - if provided, a string specifying the specific key within the path to watch. * `callback` - a function which will be invoked when changes occur to the key specified within the path.  The function should expect the following arguments:   * `watcher` - the watcher object itself   * `path`    - the path being watched   * `key`     - the specific key within the path which invoked this callback   * `old`     - the old value for this key, may be nil   * `new`     - the new value for this key, may be nil |
| Returns |  * a watchableObject |
| Notes |  * This constructor is used by code which wishes to watch state information which is being shared by other code. |

### Methods

#### [callback](#callback)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.watchable:callback(fn | nil) -> watchableObject  |
| Type        | Method |
| Description | Change or remove the callback function for the watchableObject. |
| Parameters |  * `fn` - a function, or an explicit nil to remove, specifying the new callback function to receive notifications for this watchableObject |
| Returns |  * the watchableObject |
| Notes |  * see [hs.watchable.watch](#watch) for a description of the arguments the callback function should expect.

#### [change](#change)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.watchable:change([key], value) -> watchableObject  |
| Type        | Method |
| Description | Externally change the value of the key-value pair being watched by the watchableObject |
| Parameters |  * `key`   - if the watchableObject was defined with a key of "*", this argument is required and specifies the specific key of the watched table to change the value of.  If a specific key was specified when the watchableObject was defined, this argument must not be provided. * `value` - the new value for the key. |
| Returns |  * the watchableObject |
| Notes |  * if external changes are not allowed for the specified path, this method generates an error

#### [pause](#pause)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.watchable:pause() -> watchableObject  |
| Type        | Method |
| Description | Temporarily stop notifications about the key-value pair(s) watched by this watchableObject. |
| Parameters |  * None |
| Returns |  * the watchableObject |


#### [release](#release)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.watchable:release() -> nil  |
| Type        | Method |
| Description | Removes the watchableObject so that key-value pairs watched by this object no longer generate notifications. |
| Parameters |  * None |
| Returns |  * nil |


#### [resume](#resume)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.watchable:resume() -> watchableObject  |
| Type        | Method |
| Description | Resume notifications about the key-value pair(s) watched by this watchableObject which were previously paused. |
| Parameters |  * None |
| Returns |  * the watchableObject |


#### [value](#value)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.watchable:value([key]) -> currentValue  |
| Type        | Method |
| Description | Get the current value for the key-value pair being watched by the watchableObject |
| Parameters |  * `key` - if the watchableObject was defined with a key of "*", this argument is required and specifies the specific key of the watched table to retrieve the value for.  If a specific key was specified when the watchableObject was defined, this argument is ignored. |
| Returns |  * The current value for the key-value pair being watched by the watchableObject. May be nil. |
