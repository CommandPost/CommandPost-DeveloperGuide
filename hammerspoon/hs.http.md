## API Documentation
### Variables

#### [htmlEntities[]](#htmlEntities[])
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.http.htmlEntities[]  |
| Type        | Variable |
| Description | A collection of common HTML Entities (&whatever;) and their UTF8 equivalents.  To retrieve the UTF8 sequence for a given entity, reference the table as `hs.http.htmlEntities["&key;"]` where `key` is the text of the entity's name or a numeric reference like `#number`. |
| Notes |  * This list is likely not complete.  It is based on the list of common entities described at http://www.freeformatter.com/html-entities.html. * Additional entities can be temporarily added via the `hs.http.registerEntity(...)` function.  If you feel you have a more official list of entities which contains items which are currently not included by default, please open up an issue at https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon and your link will be considered. * To see a list of the currently defined entities, a __tostring meta-method is included so that referencing the table directly as a string will return the current definitions.   * For reference, this meta-method is essentially the following: |

### Functions

#### [asyncGet](#asyncGet)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.http.asyncGet(url, headers, callback)  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Sends an HTTP GET request asynchronously |
| Parameters |  * url - A string containing the URL to retrieve * headers - A table containing string keys and values representing the request headers, or nil to add no headers * callback - A function to be called when the request succeeds or fails. The function will be passed three parameters:  * A number containing the HTTP response status  * A string containing the response body  * A table containing the response headers |
| Notes |  * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.

#### [asyncPost](#asyncPost)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.http.asyncPost(url, data, headers, callback)  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Sends an HTTP POST request asynchronously |
| Parameters |  * url - A string containing the URL to submit to * data - A string containing the request body, or nil to send no body * headers - A table containing string keys and values representing the request headers, or nil to add no headers * callback - A function to be called when the request succeeds or fails. The function will be passed three parameters:  * A number containing the HTTP response status  * A string containing the response body  * A table containing the response headers |
| Notes |  * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.

#### [convertHtmlEntities](#convertHtmlEntities)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.http.convertHtmlEntities(inString) -> outString  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Convert all recognized HTML Entities in the `inString` to appropriate UTF8 byte sequences and returns the converted text. |
| Parameters |  * inString -- A string containing any number of HTML Entities (&whatever;) in the text. |
| Returns |  * outString -- the input string with all recognized HTML Entity sequences converted to UTF8 byte sequences. |
| Notes |  * Recognized HTML Entities are those registered in `hs.http.htmlEntities` or numeric entity sequences: &#n; where `n` can be any integer number. * This function is especially useful as a post-filter to data retrieved by the `hs.http.get` and `hs.http.asyncGet` functions.

#### [doAsyncRequest](#doAsyncRequest)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|

| Type        | Function |
| Description | Creates an HTTP request and executes it asynchronously |
| Parameters |  * url - A string containing the URL * method - A string containing the HTTP method to use (e.g. "GET", "POST", etc) * data - A string containing the request body, or nil to send no body * headers - A table containing string keys and values representing request header keys and values, or nil to add no headers * callback - A function to called when the response is received. The function should accept three arguments:  * code - A number containing the HTTP response code  * body - A string containing the body of the response  * headers - A table containing the HTTP headers of the response |
| Returns |  * None |
| Notes |  * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.

#### [doRequest](#doRequest)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.http.doRequest(url, method, [data, headers]) -> int, string, table  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Creates an HTTP request and executes it synchronously |
| Parameters |  * url - A string containing the URL * method - A string containing the HTTP method to use (e.g. "GET", "POST", etc) * data - An optional string containing the data to POST to the URL, or nil to send no data * headers - An optional table of string keys and values used as headers for the request, or nil to add no headers |
| Returns |  * A number containing the HTTP response status code * A string containing the response body * A table containing the response headers |
| Notes |  * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.

#### [encodeForQuery](#encodeForQuery)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.http.encodeForQuery(string) -> string  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Returns a copy of the provided string in which characters that are not valid within an HTTP query key or value are escaped with their %## equivalent. |
| Parameters |  * originalString - the string to make safe as a key or value for a query |
| Returns |  * the converted string |
| Notes |  * The intent of this function is to provide a valid key or a valid value for a query string, not to validate the entire query string.  For this reason, ?, =, +, and & are included in the converted characters.

#### [get](#get)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.http.get(url, headers) -> int, string, table  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Sends an HTTP GET request to a URL |
| Returns |  * A number containing the HTTP response status * A string containing the response body * A table containing the response headers |
| Notes |  * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.

| Notes |  * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.

#### [registerEntity](#registerEntity)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.http.registerEntity(entity, codepoint) -> string  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Registers an HTML Entity with the specified Unicode codepoint which can later referenced in your code as `hs.http.htmlEntity[entity]` for convenience and readability. |
| Parameters |  * entity -- The full text of the HTML Entity as it appears in HTML encoded documents.  A proper entity starts with & and ends with ; and entity labels which do not meet this will have them added -- future dereferences to get the corresponding UTF8 *must* include this initiator and terminator or they will not be recognized. * codepoint -- a Unicode codepoint in numeric or `U+xxxx` format to register with as the given entity. |
| Returns |  * Returns the UTF8 byte sequence for the entity registered. |
| Notes |  * If an entity label was previously registered, this will overwrite the previous value with a new one. * The return value is merely syntactic sugar and you do not need to save it locally; it can be safely ignored -- future access to the pre-converted entity should be retrieved as `hs.http.htmlEntities[entity]` in your code.  It looks good when invoked from the console, though âº.

#### [urlParts](#urlParts)
|             |                 |

See notes for more information.   * relativePath             - the relative path of the URL without resolving against its base URL. If the path has a trailing slash it is stripped. If the URL is already an absolute URL, this contains the same value as path.   * relativeString           - a string representation of the relative portion of the URL. If the URL is already an absolute URL this contains the same value as absoluteString.   * resourceSpecifier        - the resource specified in the URL   * scheme                   - the scheme of the URL   * standardizedURL          - the URL with any instances of ".." or "." removed from its path   * user                     - the username, if specified in the URL |
| Notes |  * This function assumes that the URL conforms to RFC 1808.  If the URL is malformed or does not conform to RFC1808, then many of these fields may be missing. |
