### Functions

#### [apply](#apply)
| Signature   | hs.layout.apply(table[, windowTitleComparator])  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Applies a layout to applications/windows |
      ```layout1 = {
            {"Mail", nil, "Color LCD", hs.layout.maximized, nil, nil},
            {"Safari", nil, "Thunderbolt Display", hs.layout.maximized, nil, nil},
            {"iTunes", "iTunes", "Color LCD", hs.layout.maximized, nil, nil},
            {"iTunes", "MiniPlayer", "Color LCD", nil, nil, hs.geometry.rect(0, -48, 400, 48)},
          }```
     * An example of a function that works well as a `windowTitleComparator` is the Lua built-in `string.match`, which uses Lua Patterns to match strings
| Parameters |  * table - A table describing your desired layout. Each element in the table should be another table describing a set of windows to match, and their desired size/position. The fields in each of these tables are:  * A string containing an application name, or an `hs.application` object, or nil  * A string containing a window title or nil  * A string containing a screen name, or an `hs.screen` object, or a function that accepts no parameters and returns an `hs.screen` object, or nil to select the first available screen  * A Unit rect, or a function which is called for each window and returns a unit rect (see `hs.window.moveToUnit()`). The function should accept one parameter, which is the window object.  * A Frame rect, or a function which is called for each window and returns a frame rect (see `hs.screen:frame()`). The function should accept one parameter, which is the window object.  * A Full-frame rect, of a function which is called for each window and returns a full-frame rect (see `hs.screen:fullFrame()`). The function should accept one parameter, which is the window object. * windowTitleComparator - (optional) Function to use for window title comparison. It is called with two string arguments (below) and its return value is evaluated as a boolean. If no comparator is provided, the '==' operator is used  * windowTitle: The `:title()` of the window object being examined  * layoutWindowTitle: The window title string (second field) specified in each element of the layout table | | Returns |  * None | | Notes |  * If the application name argument is nil, window titles will be matched regardless of which app they belong to * If the window title argument is nil, all windows of the specified application will be matched * You can specify both application name and window title if you want to match only one window of a particular application * If you specify neither application name or window title, no windows will be matched :) * Monitor name is a string, as found in `hs.screen:name()`. You can also pass an `hs.screen` object, or a function that returns an `hs.screen` object. If you pass nil, the first screen will be selected * The final three arguments use `hs.geometry.rect()` objects to describe the desired position and size of matched windows:   * Unit rect will be passed to `hs.window.moveToUnit()`   * Frame rect will be passed to `hs.window.setFrame()` (including menubar and dock)   * Full-frame rect will be passed to `hs.window.setFrame()` (ignoring menubar and dock) * If either the x or y components of frame/full-frame rect are negative, they will be applied as offsets against the opposite edge of the screen (e.g. If x is -100 then the left edge of the window will be 100 pixels from the right edge of the screen) * Only one of the rect arguments will apply to any matched windows. If you specify more than one, the first will win * An example usage: |
