* [new](#new)
* Methods - API calls which can only be made on an object returned by a constructor

## API Documentation

### Constructors

#### [new](#new)
| Signature   | hs.timer.delayed.new(delay, fn) -> hs.timer.delayed object  |
| Type        | Constructor |
| Description | Creates a new delayed timer. |
  Delayed timers have specialized methods that behave differently from regular timers.
    When the `:start()` method is invoked, the timer will wait for `delay` seconds before calling `fn()`;
    this is referred to as the callback countdown. If `:start()` is invoked again before `delay` has elapsed,
    the countdown starts over again.
    You can use a delayed timer to coalesce processing of unpredictable asynchronous events into a single
    callback; for example, if you have an event stream that happens in "bursts" of dozens of events at once,
    set an appropriate `delay` to wait for things to settle down, and then your callback will run just once.
| Parameters |  * delay - number of seconds to wait for after a `:start()` invocation (the "callback countdown") * fn - a function to call after `delay` has fully elapsed without any further `:start()` invocations | | Returns |  * a new `hs.timer.delayed` object | | Notes |   * these timers are meant to be long-lived: once instantiated, there's no way to remove them from the run loop;    create them once at the module level. | 
### Methods

#### [nextTrigger](#nextTrigger)
| Signature   | hs.timer.delayed:nextTrigger() -> number or nil  |
| Type        | Method |
| Description | Returns the time left in the callback countdown |
| Parameters |   * None | | Returns |   * if the callback countdown is running, returns the number of seconds until it triggers; otherwise returns nil | 
#### [running](#running)
| Signature   | hs.timer.delayed:running() -> boolean  |
| Type        | Method |
| Description | Returns a boolean indicating whether the callback countdown is running |
| Parameters |   * None | | Returns |   * a boolean | 
#### [setDelay](#setDelay)
| Signature   | hs.timer.delayed:setDelay(delay) -> hs.timer.delayed object  |
| Type        | Method |
| Description | Changes the callback countdown duration |
| Parameters |   * None | | Returns |   * the delayed timer object | | Notes |   * if the callback countdown is running, calling this method will restart it | 
#### [start](#start)
| Signature   | hs.timer.delayed:start([delay]) -> hs.timer.delayed object  |
| Type        | Method |
| Description | Starts or restarts the callback countdown |
| Parameters |   * delay - (optional) if provided, sets the countdown duration to this number of seconds    for this time only; subsequent calls to `:start()` will revert to the original delay (or    to the delay set with `:setDelay(delay)`) | | Returns |   * the delayed timer object | 
#### [stop](#stop)
| Signature   | hs.timer.delayed:stop() -> hs.timer.delayed object  |
| Type        | Method |
| Description | Cancels the callback countdown, if running; the callback will therefore not be triggered |
| Parameters |   * None | | Returns |   * the delayed timer object |
