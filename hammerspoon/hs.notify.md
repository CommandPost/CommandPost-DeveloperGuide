# [docs](index.md) Â» hs.notify
---

This module allows you to create on screen notifications in the User Notification Center located at the right of the users screen.

Notifications can be sent immediately or scheduled for delivery at a later time, even if that scheduled time occurs when Hammerspoon is not currently running. Currently, if you take action on a notification while Hammerspoon is not running, the callback function is not honored for the first notification clicked upon -- This is expected to be fixed in a future release.

When setting up a callback function, you have the option of specifying it with the creation of the notification (hs.notify.new) or by pre-registering it with hs.notify.register and then referring it to by the tag name specified with hs.notify.register. If you use this registration method for defining your callback functions, and make sure to register all expected callback functions within your init.lua file or files it includes, then callback functions will remain available for existing notifications in the User Notification Center even if Hammerspoon's configuration is reloaded or if Hammerspoon is restarted. If the callback tag is not present when the user acts on the notification, the Hammerspoon console will be raised as a default action.

A shorthand, based upon the original inspiration for this module from Hydra and Mjolnir, hs.notify.show, is provided if you just require a quick and simple informative notification without the bells and whistles.

This module is based in part on code from the previous incarnation of Mjolnir by [Steven Degutis](https://github.com/sdegutis/).

## API Documentation

| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.notify.activationTypes[]  |
| Type        | Constant |
| Description | Convenience array of the possible activation types for a notification, and their reverse for reference. |
| Notes |  * Count starts at zero. (implemented in Objective-C)

#### [defaultNotificationSound](#defaultNotificationSound)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.notify.defaultNotificationSound  |
| Type        | Constant |
| Description | The string representation of the default notification sound. Use `hs.notify:soundName()` or set the `soundName` attribute in `hs:notify.new()`, to this constant, if you want to use the default sound |
 |

### Variables

| Signature   | hs.notify.registry[]  |
| Type        | Variable |
| Description | A table containing the registered callback functions and their tags. |
| Notes |  * This table should not be modified directly. Use the `hs.notify.register(tag, fn)` and `hs.notify.unregister(id)` functions. * This table has a __tostring metamethod so you can see the list of registered function tags in the console by typing `hs.notify.registry` * If a notification attempts to perform a callback to a function tag which is not present in this table, a warning will be printed in the console.

#### [warnAboutMissingFunctionTag](#warnAboutMissingFunctionTag)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.notify.warnAboutMissingFunctionTag  |
| Type        | Variable |
| Description | A boolean value indicating whether or not a missing notification function tag should cause a warning to be printed to the console during activation callback. Defaults to true. |

### Functions

#### [register](#register)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.notify.register(tag, fn) -> id  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Registers a function callback with the specified tag for a notification. The callback function will be invoked when the user clicks on or interacts with a notification. |
| Parameters |  * tag - a string tag to identify the registered callback function. Use this as the function tag in `hs.notify.new` and `hs.notify.show` * fn  - the function which should be invoked when a notification with this tag is interacted with. |
| Returns |  * a numerical id representing the entry in `hs.notify.registry` for this function. This number can be used with `hs.notify.unregister` to unregister a function later if you wish. |
| Notes |  * If a function is already registered with the specified tag, it is replaced by with the new one.

#### [unregister](#unregister)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.notify.unregister(id|tag)  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Unregisters a function callback so that it is no longer available as a callback when notifications corresponding to the specified entry are interacted with. |
| Parameters |  * id or tag - the numerical id provided by `hs.notify.register` or string tag representing the callback function to be removed |
| Returns |  * None |

| Signature   | hs.notify.unregisterall()  |
| Type        | Function |
| Description | Unregisters all functions registered as callbacks. |
| Parameters |  * None |
| Returns |  * None |
| Notes |  * This does not remove the notifications from the User Notification Center, it just removes their callback function for when the user interacts with them. To remove all notifications, see `hs.notify.withdrawAll` and `hs.notify.withdrawAllScheduled`

#### [withdrawAll](#withdrawAll)
|             |                 |

| Type        | Function |
| Description | Withdraw all delivered notifications from Hammerspoon |
| Parameters |  * None |
| Returns |  * None |
| Notes |  * This will withdraw all notifications for Hammerspoon, including those not sent by this module or that linger from a previous load of Hammerspoon.

#### [withdrawAllScheduled](#withdrawAllScheduled)
|             |                 |

 |

### Constructors

#### [new](#new)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.notify.new([fn,][attributes]) -> notification  |
| Type        | Constructor |
| Description | Creates a new notification object |
| Parameters |  * fn - An optional function or function-tag, which will be called when the user interacts with notifications. The notification object will be passed as an argument to the function. If you leave this parameter out or specify nil, then no callback will be attached to the notification. * attributes - An optional table for applying attributes to the notification. Possible keys are: |
| Returns |  * A notification object |
| Notes |  * A function-tag is a string key which corresponds to a function stored in the `hs.notify.registry` table with the `hs.notify.register()` function. * If a notification does not have a `title` attribute set, OS X will not display it, so by default it will be set to "Notification". You can use the `title` key in the attributes table, or call `hs.notify:title()` before displaying the notification to change this.

#### [show](#show)
|             |                 |
| ------------|-----------------|
| Signature   | hs.notify.show(title, subTitle, information[, tag]) -> notfication  |
| Type        | Constructor |
| Description | Shorthand constructor to create and show simple notifications |
| Parameters |  * title       - the title for the notification * subTitle    - the subtitle, or second line, of the notification * information - the main textual body of the notification * tag         - a function tag corresponding to a function registered with `hs.notify.register` |
| Returns |  * a notification object |
| Notes |  * All three textual parameters are required, though they can be empty strings * This function is really a shorthand for `hs.notify.new(...):send()` |
