Move/resize windows within a grid

The grid partitions your screens for the purposes of window management. The default layout of the grid is 3 columns by 3 rows.
You can specify different grid layouts for different screens and/or screen resolutions.

Windows that are aligned with the grid have their location and size described as a `cell`. Each cell is an `hs.geometry` rect with these fields:
 * x - The column of the left edge of the window
 * y - The row of the top edge of the window
 * w - The number of columns the window occupies
 * h - The number of rows the window occupies

For a grid of 3x3:
 * a cell `'0,0 1x1'` will be in the upper-left corner
 * a cell `'2,0 1x1'` will be in the upper-right corner
 * and so on...

Additionally, a modal keyboard driven interface for interactive resizing is provided via `hs.grid.show()`;
The grid will be overlaid on the focused or frontmost window's screen with keyboard hints.
To resize/move the window, you can select the corner cells of the desired position.
For a move-only, you can select a cell and confirm with 'return'. The celected cell will become the new upper-left of the window.
You can also use the arrow keys to move the window onto adjacent screens, and the tab/shift-tab keys to cycle to the next/previous window.
Once you selected a cell, you can use the arrow keys to navigate through the grid. In this case, the grid will highlight the selected cells.
After highlighting enough cells, press enter to move/resize the window to the highlighted area.

### Variables

#### [HINTS](#HINTS)
| | |
|-|-|
| Signature   | hs.grid.HINTS  |
| Type        | Variable |
| Description | A bidimensional array (table of tables of strings) holding the keyboard hints (as per `hs.keycodes.map`) to be used for the interactive resizing interface. |
  Change this if you don't use a QWERTY layout; you need to provide 5 valid rows of hints (even if you're not going to use all 5 rows)
| Notes |  * `hs.inspect(hs.grid.HINTS)` from the console will show you how the table is built | 
#### [ui](#ui)
| | |
|-|-|
| Signature   | hs.grid.ui  |
| Type        | Variable |
| Description | Allows customization of the modal resizing grid user interface |
  This table contains variables that you can change to customize the look of the modal resizing grid.
    The default values are shown in the right hand side of the assignements below.
    To represent color values, you can use:
     * a table {red=redN, green=greenN, blue=blueN, alpha=alphaN}
     * a table {redN,greenN,blueN[,alphaN]} - if omitted alphaN defaults to 1.0
    where redN, greenN etc. are the desired value for the color component between 0.0 and 1.0
    The following variables must be color values:
     * `hs.grid.ui.textColor = {1,1,1}`
     * `hs.grid.ui.cellColor = {0,0,0,0.25}`
     * `hs.grid.ui.cellStrokeColor = {0,0,0}`
     * `hs.grid.ui.selectedColor = {0.2,0.7,0,0.4}` -- for the first selected cell during a modal resize
     * `hs.grid.ui.highlightColor = {0.8,0.8,0,0.5}` -- to highlight the frontmost window behind the grid
     * `hs.grid.ui.highlightStrokeColor = {0.8,0.8,0,1}`
     * `hs.grid.ui.cyclingHighlightColor = {0,0.8,0.8,0.5}` -- to highlight the window to be resized, when cycling among windows
     * `hs.grid.ui.cyclingHighlightStrokeColor = {0,0.8,0.8,1}`
    The following variables must be numbers (in screen points):
     * `hs.grid.ui.textSize = 200`
     * `hs.grid.ui.cellStrokeWidth = 5`
     * `hs.grid.ui.highlightStrokeWidth = 30`
    The following variables must be strings:
     * `hs.grid.ui.fontName = 'Lucida Grande'`
    The following variables must be booleans:
     * `hs.grid.ui.showExtraKeys = true` -- show non-grid keybindings in the center of the grid
