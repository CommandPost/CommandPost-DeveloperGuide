Watch paths recursively for changes

This simple example watches your Hammerspoon directory for changes, and when it sees a change, reloads your configs:

    local myWatcher = hs.pathwatcher.new(os.getenv("HOME") .. "/.hammerspoon/", hs.reload):start()

This module is based primarily on code from the previous incarnation of Mjolnir by [Steven Degutis](https://github.com/sdegutis/).
