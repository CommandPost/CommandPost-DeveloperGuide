## API Documentation

### Constants

#### additionalImageNames[]
  * Signature: hs.image.additionalImageNames[]
  * Type: Constant
  * Description: Table of arrays containing the names of additional internal system images which may also be available for use with `hs.drawing.image` and [hs.image.imageFromName](#imageFromName).
  * Notes:
     * The list of these images was pulled from a collection located in the repositories at https://github.com/hetima?tab=repositories.  As these image names are (for the most part) not formally listed in Apple's documentation or published APIs, their use cannot be guaranteed across all OS X versions.  If you identify any images which may be missing or could be added, please file an issue at https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon.

#### systemImageNames[]
  * Signature: hs.image.systemImageNames[]
  * Type: Constant
  * Description: Table containing the names of internal system images for use with hs.drawing.image
  * Notes:
     * Image names pulled from NSImage.h
     * This table has a __tostring() metamethod which allows listing it's contents in the Hammerspoon console by typing `hs.image.systemImageNames`.

### Constructors

#### iconForFile
  * Signature: hs.image.iconForFile(file) -> object
  * Type: Constructor
  * Description: Creates an `hs.image` object for the file or files specified
  * Parameters:
     * file - the path to a file or an array of files to generate an icon for.
  * Returns:
     * An `hs.image` object or nil, if there was an error.  The image will be the icon for the specified file or an icon representing multiple files if an array of multiple files is specified.

#### iconForFileType
  * Signature: hs.image.iconForFileType(fileType) -> object
  * Type: Constructor
  * Description: Creates an `hs.image` object of the icon for the specified file type.
  * Parameters:
     * fileType - the file type, specified as a filename extension or a universal type identifier (UTI).
  * Returns:
     * An `hs.image` object or nil, if there was an error

#### imageFromASCII
  * Signature: hs.image.imageFromASCII(ascii[, context]) -> object
  * Type: Constructor
  * Description: Creates an image from an ASCII representation with the specified context.
  * Parameters:
     * ascii - A string containing a representation of an image
     * context - An optional table containing the context for each shape in the image.  A shape is considered a single drawing element (point, ellipse, line, or polygon) as defined at https://github.com/cparnot/ASCIImage and http://cocoamine.net/blog/2015/03/20/replacing-photoshop-with-nsstring/.
       * The context table is an optional (possibly sparse) array in which the index represents the order in which the shapes are defined.  The last (highest) numbered index in the sparse array specifies the default settings for any unspecified index and any settings which are not explicitly set in any other given index.
       * Each index consists of a table which can contain one or more of the following keys:
         * fillColor - the color with which the shape will be filled (defaults to black)  Color is defined in a table containing color component values between 0.0 and 1.0 for each of the keys:
           * red (default 0.0)
           * green (default 0.0)
           * blue (default 0.0)
           * alpha (default 1.0)
         * strokeColor - the color with which the shape will be stroked (defaults to black)
         * lineWidth - the line width (number) for the stroke of the shape (defaults to 1 if anti-aliasing is on or (âˆš2)/2 if it is off -- approximately 0.7)
         * shouldClose - a boolean indicating whether or not the shape should be closed (defaults to true)
         * antialias - a boolean indicating whether or not the shape should be antialiased (defaults to true)
  * Returns:
     * An `hs.image` object, or nil if an error occured
  * Notes:
     * To use the ASCII diagram image support, see https://github.com/cparnot/ASCIImage and http://cocoamine.net/blog/2015/03/20/replacing-photoshop-with-nsstring
     * The default for lineWidth, when antialiasing is off, is defined within the ASCIImage library. Geometrically it represents one half of the hypotenuse of the unit right-triangle and is a more accurate representation of a "real" point size when dealing with arbitrary angles and lines than 1.0 would be.

#### imageFromAppBundle
  * Signature: hs.image.imageFromAppBundle(bundleID) -> object
  * Type: Constructor
  * Description: Creates an `hs.image` object using the icon from an App
  * Parameters:
     * bundleID - A string containing the bundle identifier of an application
  * Returns:
     * An `hs.image` object or nil, if no app icon was found

#### imageFromMediaFile
  * Signature: hs.image.imageFromMediaFile(file) -> object
  * Type: Constructor
  * Description: Creates an `hs.image` object from a video file or the album artwork of an audio file or directory
  * Parameters:
     * file - A string containing the path to an audio or video file or an album directory
  * Returns:
     * An `hs.image` object
  * Notes:
     * If a thumbnail can be generated for a video file, it is returned as an `hs.image` object, otherwise the filetype icon
     * For audio files, this function first determines the containing directory (if not already a directory)
     * It checks if any of the following common filenames for album art are present:
      * cover.jpg
      * front.jpg
      * art.jpg
      * album.jpg
      * folder.jpg
     * If one of the common album art filenames is found, it is returned as an `hs.image` object
     * This is faster than extracting image metadata and allows for obtaining artwork associated with file formats such as .flac/.ogg
     * If no common album art filenames are found, it attempts to extract image metadata from the file. This works for .mp3/.m4a files
     * If embedded image metadata is found, it is returned as an `hs.image` object, otherwise the filetype icon

#### imageFromName
  * Signature: hs.image.imageFromName(string) -> object
  * Type: Constructor
  * Description: Returns the hs.image object for the specified name, if it exists.
  * Parameters:
     * Name - the name of the image to return.
  * Returns:
     * An hs.image object or nil, if no image was found with the specified name.
  * Notes:
     * Some predefined labels corresponding to OS X System default images can be found in `hs.image.systemImageNames`.
     * Names are not required to be unique: The search order is as follows, and the first match found is returned:
        * an image whose name was explicitly set with the `setName` method since the last full restart of Hammerspoon
        * Hammerspoon's main application bundle
        * the Application Kit framework (this is where most of the images listed in `hs.image.systemImageNames` are located)
     * Image names can be assigned by the image creator or by calling the `hs.image:setName` method on an hs.image object.

#### imageFromPath
  * Signature: hs.image.imageFromPath(path) -> object
  * Type: Constructor
  * Description: Loads an image file
  * Parameters:
     * path - A string containing the path to an image file on disk
  * Returns:
     * An `hs.image` object, or nil if an error occured

#### imageFromURL
  * Signature: hs.image.imageFromURL(url) -> object
  * Type: Constructor
  * Description: Creates an `hs.image` object from the contents of the specified URL.
  * Parameters:
     * url - a web url specifying the location of the image to retrieve
  * Returns:
     * An `hs.image` object or nil, if the url does not specify image contents or is unreachable
